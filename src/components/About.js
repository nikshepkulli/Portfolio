        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, specializing in data science
        and machine learning. As a Research Assistant at Sacred Heart
        University, I've dedicated myself to advancing the field, contributing
        to a 50% reduction in laboratory accidents. My academic focus includes
        using Python, R, and SQL for projects like breast cancer prediction,
        sentiment analysis, and COVID-19 tweet modeling, achieving consistently
        high accuracy. In a Data Science Virtual Intern role at British Airways,
        I refined skills in web scraping and predictive modeling, employing
        tools such as Beautiful Soup, Scikit-learn, and Random Forest. With over
        four years as a Software Engineer at Cerner Corporation, I enhanced AI
        and ML-based life-saving technology, improved data collection
        frameworks, and streamlined workflows. Proficient in Java, C, C++, C#,
        JS, and big data technologies, I integrated Agile and semantic
        versioning methodologies. Driven by a passion for applying data science
        and machine learning to solve real-world challenges and drive business
        growth, I am ready to make meaningful contributions to the academic
        community and push the boundaries of knowledge in computer science
        during my Ph.D. journey.
